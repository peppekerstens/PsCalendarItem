            contributers:
                Peppe Kerstens
            changes:
                Rename from PSCalendar to PSCalenderItem because of conflicting existing PSCalendar PS module within PSGallery
                Version reset (main version from 1 to 0); this is not a finished solution. Can be done because of rename module. New Goals: 
                    Make current functionality "code/test/help/document complete"
                    vNext: Detach logic from input/output
                    vNext: Consider implement some sort of generic input provider. Current contender is https://github.com/JustinGrote/PowerConfig
                    vNext: Consider class based
